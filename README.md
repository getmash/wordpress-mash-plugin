# Mash Wallet Wordpress plugin

Mash makes it easy for your users to pay-you-as-they-enjoy directly, for any amount. Your users can pay, donate and more for any action, usage, event or experience – whether revealing content/information, voting, watching, listening, clicking a “thanks boost” or filling out a form and usage. If you haven't already setup an earner account, please visit the Earner Dashboard to get started. You will need your earner_id from the dashboard.

## Getting Started

To set this plugin up, you first need an earner account on the [Mash Platform](https://www.getmash.com/). This will configure the wallet on your site to your earner account so you can quickly monetize content.

To setup a earner account, please visit the [Earner Dashboard](https://wallet.getmash.com/earn) and create an account.
