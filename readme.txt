== Overview of Creator Monetization Tools ==
  
[Mash](https://getmash.com) makes it easy to earn more for your quality experiences. It’s the fastest & easiest way for your users to donate & pay for your content – at any price, large or small. It works for articles, instant-one-click-donations, video content, downloading files and more.

**Boosts**, let your fans one-click-donate and say “thanks” at the same time. Each tap is a $0.05 contribution, and you get to learn what they love most – without them having to type in a credit card in every-time. 

**Content Monetization Widgets** allow you to earn more in new and interactive ways – no large purchase commitment barriers. You set pricing and they pay-as-they-enjoy to access an article, watch a great video, and even to get secret details like your email. You can have your users support you automatically, or with one-click for your amazing experiences. 

**Mash Wallet** enables your users have access to their money to use on your site, across the internet, and to send where they want.
